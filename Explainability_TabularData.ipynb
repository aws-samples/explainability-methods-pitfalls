SHAP values provide an answer to the question: \"What are the contributions of the input features toward the output prediction?\". SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory (see [paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/8a20a8621978632d76c43dfd28b67767-Abstract.html) for details).\n",

This is done for all possible permutations of features to compute a weighted average of the marginal effects. Because all permutations need to be considered SHAP has high computational complexity (some approximations/simplifications are implemented in the library to speed up the process). Let's have a look at SHAP values and plots for our dataset. To make the explanations more readable, we extract the features names (for encoded categorical columns) and create a small sample data frame."

For instance, `amount` in our dataset can vary in the thousands but `duration` only varies in the tens.
